View The :stars:

I like to star repos constantly. It's like giving them a big :+1: and saying, "Hi, I like this".

But then I forget about that repo. I don't want email notifications about it because I don't want to watch it. Of course there is a [stars](https://github.com/stars) URL, but that still requires me to go through **so many** repos.

What I really want is to peer through a telescope and look onto the stars and find out what's going on with them. I need to become an astronomer.
